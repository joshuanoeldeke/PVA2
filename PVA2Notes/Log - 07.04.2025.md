### 2nd Draft (including reference to Barbosa and Hora)
This paper builds upon prior research into Python testing framework migration, particularly the work of Barbosa and Hora on "How and Why Developers Migrate Python Tests", by exploring the performance differences between pytest and unittest. While earlier studies have focused on migration processes and developer motivations, this study emphasizes key technical metrics—execution time, memory usage, and scalability—to provide actionable insights for developers choosing the most suitable framework for their projects. By conducting experiments in a controlled environment, the study ensures reproducibility and fairness in its comparisons. The findings not only deepen understanding of how these frameworks perform under varying conditions but also offer practical guidance for optimizing software testing in Python.

## Thoughts/Notes
https://claude.ai/chat/0dab5708-3777-4500-932f-695bcf6b7376
### Research Approach (by Claude)
1. **Define test scenarios**: Create equivalent test suites in both frameworks covering different testing patterns
2. **Set up measurement infrastructure**: Code to accurately measure execution time and memory usage
3. **Design experiments**: Tests with varying complexity, size, and features
4. **Analyze results**: Compare metrics and identify performance patterns

1. **Expand test complexity**: Create larger test suites with more complex assertions and setup
2. **Measure scaling**: Test how performance changes with test suite size
3. **Feature-specific tests**: Measure performance impacts of specific features like fixtures, parameterization, etc.
4. **Environment variations**: Test on different Python versions or hardware
5. **Analysis script**: Create visualization code to analyze and present your findings

## STILL TO DO:
Scalability
Enhanced Science + Statistics


## How Subprocess Works in Your Implementation

Your code uses subprocess to isolate test execution, which is critical for accurate measurement:

1. **Process Isolation:**
    
    - `subprocess.run()` spawns a completely separate process to run your tests3
        
    - This prevents the measurement code from affecting the metrics of the tests themselves
        
2. **Command Execution:**
    
    - Your implementation passes command lists like `[python_exe, "-m", "unittest", unittest_file]` to execute tests3
        
    - The command runs in isolation while your main process monitors timing and memory
        
3. **Output Capture:**
    
    - The `stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE` parameters capture all output for later analysis3
        
    - This prevents output operations from affecting timing measurements
        
4. **Measurement Accuracy:**
    
    - The process isolation allows memory delta measurements to reflect only what the test framework uses
        
    - Without subprocess, memory measurements would include overhead from your measurement code2
        

This approach is scientifically sound as it reduces measurement artifacts and provides cleaner data about the actual performance characteristics of each testing framework34.

## Changes (Perplexity/Claude)
### Prompt
ok, i think i am increasing the iterations to 1000. also, how would i implement the following suggestions: warmup runs measure peak memory usage track cpu utilization (percentage?) measure test setup time seperately from execution time add confidence intervals implement hypothesis testing (t-tests) bootstrap resampling (?) also, how would i add a part about scalability to the paper, or would you just leave that out since the current experiment relies on a very basic example script?

### Changes
#### Implementing Warmup Runs
Add a warmup parameter to your measurement method:
```
def measure_performance_subprocess(self, command_list, iterations=5, warmup_runs=3):
    """Measure execution time and memory usage using subprocess with warmup runs."""
    print(f"Performing {warmup_runs} warmup runs...")
    
    # Execute warmup runs without recording metrics
    for i in range(warmup_runs):
        subprocess.run(command_list, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        
    print(f"Measuring {self.framework} on {self.test_suite} ({iterations} iterations)...")
    # Continue with your existing measurement code...
```
#### Measuring Peak Memory Usage
Modify your code to capture peak memory during test execution:
```
def measure_performance_subprocess(self, command_list, iterations=5):
    # Existing code...
    
    # Create a process to monitor memory during test execution
    def get_peak_memory(pid):
        process = psutil.Process(pid)
        peak_memory = 0
        while process.is_running():
            try:
                current = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
                peak_memory = max(peak_memory, current)
                time.sleep(0.01)  # Sample every 10ms
            except:
                break
        return peak_memory
    
    # Launch subprocess and monitor in parallel
    process = subprocess.Popen(command_list, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    
    import threading
    memory_thread = threading.Thread(target=get_peak_memory, args=(process.pid,))
    memory_thread.start()
    
    # Wait for completion
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    memory_thread.join()
    
    # Store both delta and peak memory
    run_data["peak_memory_mb"] = peak_memory

```

#### Tracking CPU Utilization
Add CPU measurement with a similar approach:
```
def get_cpu_utilization(pid):
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    cpu_samples = []
    while process.is_running():
        try:
            cpu_samples.append(process.cpu_percent(interval=0.1))
        except:
            break
    return {
        "mean": statistics.mean(cpu_samples) if cpu_samples else 0,
        "max": max(cpu_samples) if cpu_samples else 0
    }

# Use in a similar thread-based approach as the peak memory monitoring

```
#### Separating Setup and Execution Time
Create a modified test runner that outputs timestamps:
```
def create_instrumented_test_file(original_file, output_file):
    """Create a version of the test file that logs setup and execution times."""
    with open(original_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # For unittest
    if "unittest" in original_file:
        instrumented = (
            "import time, json\n"
            "_timing = {}\n"
            "_timing['setup_start'] = time.time()\n" + 
            content.replace("if __name__ == \"__main__\":", 
                           "_timing['setup_end'] = time.time()\n"
                           "_timing['execution_start'] = time.time()\n"
                           "if __name__ == \"__main__\":") +
            "\n_timing['execution_end'] = time.time()\n"
            "with open('timing.json', 'w') as f:\n"
            "    json.dump(_timing, f)\n"
        )
    
    # Similar approach for pytest
    
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(instrumented)
    
    return output_file

```

#### Adding Confidence Intervals
Use scipy to calculate confidence intervals in your summary stats:
```
from scipy import stats

def get_summary(self):
    """Compute summary statistics with confidence intervals."""
    times = [run["execution_time_seconds"] for run in self.results["runs"]]
    
    # Calculate 95% confidence interval
    confidence = 0.95
    n = len(times)
    mean = statistics.mean(times)
    stdev = statistics.stdev(times) if n > 1 else 0
    
    # t-distribution for small sample sizes
    t_value = stats.t.ppf((1 + confidence) / 2, n - 1)
    margin = t_value * stdev / (n ** 0.5)
    
    summary = {
        # Existing fields...
        "execution_time": {
            # Existing stats...
            "confidence_interval": (mean - margin, mean + margin),
            "confidence_level": confidence
        }
    }
    # Similar for memory metrics...

```
#### Implementing Hypothesis Testing
Add t-test comparison between frameworks:
```
def compare_frameworks(unittest_metrics, pytest_metrics):
    """Perform statistical hypothesis testing between frameworks."""
    unittest_times = [run["execution_time_seconds"] for run in unittest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    pytest_times = [run["execution_time_seconds"] for run in pytest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(unittest_times, pytest_times, equal_var=False)
    
    return {
        "t_statistic": t_stat,
        "p_value": p_value,
        "significant_difference": p_value < 0.05,
        "faster_framework": "unittest" if statistics.mean(unittest_times) < statistics.mean(pytest_times) else "pytest"
    }

```
#### Bootstrap Resampling
Add bootstrap resampling for more robust statistics:
```
def bootstrap_stats(data, statistic_func, num_samples=1000):
    """Perform bootstrap resampling on the provided data."""
    n = len(data)
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        # Sample with replacement
        sample = [data[random.randint(0, n-1)] for _ in range(n)]
        results.append(statistic_func(sample))
    
    # Calculate 95% confidence interval
    results.sort()
    lower = results[int(0.025 * num_samples)]
    upper = results[int(0.975 * num_samples)]
    
    return {
        "mean": statistics.mean(results),
        "confidence_interval": (lower, upper)
    }

```
#### Adding Scalability Analysis to Your Paper
Even with a basic calculator example, you can demonstrate scalability by:
1. **Creating test suites of varying sizes:**
```
def generate_scale_test(size):
    """Generate a test file with a specified number of test cases."""
    with open(f"test_calculator_scale_{size}.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("import unittest\nfrom example_test_module import Calculator\n\n")
        f.write("class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):\n")
        f.write("    def setUp(self):\n        self.calc = Calculator()\n\n")
        
        for i in range(size):
            f.write(f"    def test_add_{i}(self):\n")
            f.write(f"        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add({i}, {i+1}), {2*i+1})\n\n")

```
2. **Analyzing execution time growth:**  
    Run tests with 10, 50, 100, 500 tests and plot execution time vs. test count
3. **Measuring fixture reuse efficiency:**  
    Compare how each framework handles reusing the calculator fixture across many tests
4. **Analyzing parallel execution scaling:**  
    Test how pytest's parallel execution compares to unittest at different test counts:
```
# For pytest parallel testing
pytest_cmd = [python_exe, "-m", "pytest", pytest_file, "-v", "-xvs", "-n", "4"]   
```

# Dealing with Contradictions (Perplexity/Claude)
Based on your updated code and comprehensive benchmark results (100 iterations with bootstrap statistics), I would frame your paper around the fascinating tension between objective performance metrics and subjective developer preferences. Your data reveals a clear dichotomy that makes for a compelling research narrative.

## Framing Your Paper: Performance vs. Preference

Your results show that unittest significantly outperforms pytest in execution speed:

- Unittest: 0.137s mean execution time
    
- Pytest: 0.338s mean execution time (approximately 2.5x slower)
    

However, memory usage is surprisingly similar:

- Unittest: 0.190MB mean usage
    
- Pytest: 0.180MB mean usage (slightly more efficient)
    

This creates an intriguing research question: **Why do developers increasingly migrate to a framework that objectively performs worse?**

## Structure for Your Paper

**Introduction:**  
Begin by establishing this apparent contradiction—pytest's growing popularity despite inferior performance—as your central research problem.

**Literature Review:**  
Contrast Barbosa and Hora's findings on developer preferences with your objective performance metrics. Note their finding that pytest code is 34% smaller than equivalent unittest code[7](https://trunk.io/learn/pytest-vs-unittest-a-comparison), suggesting a trade-off between code brevity and runtime performance.

**Results Section:**  
Present your performance data with confidence intervals and bootstrap statistics, emphasizing the robust nature of your findings (100 iterations).

**Discussion:**  
This becomes the most valuable section, where you explore:

1. **The Performance-Usability Trade-off:** Developers willingly sacrifice some performance for improved testing experiences, as indicated by multiple sources[7](https://trunk.io/learn/pytest-vs-unittest-a-comparison)[8](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/03/pytest-vs-unittest/)[9](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/pytest-vs-unittest-comparison).
    
2. **Beyond Raw Performance:** Analyze what pytest offers that compensates for slower execution:
    
    - "Fixtures can be scoped to modules, classes, or functions, and they can be reused across multiple tests, making them easier to manage in larger test suites"[9](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/pytest-vs-unittest-comparison)
        
    - "Pytest's flexibility shines with its fixtures and parameterization, offering more advanced testing capabilities than unittest"[7](https://trunk.io/learn/pytest-vs-unittest-a-comparison)
        
3. **Framework Selection Framework:** Develop a decision matrix that helps developers understand when performance matters most vs. when other factors should take precedence.
    

## Handling the Apparent Contradiction

Rather than seeing your results as contradicting the paper you're referencing, present them as complementary insights that enable a more complete understanding:

"While Barbosa and Hora documented developers' preference for pytest's concise syntax and fixture flexibility, our research quantifies the performance cost of these benefits. This cost-benefit relationship has not been previously quantified, providing developers with crucial information for making framework selection decisions based on their specific priorities."

The JetBrains Guide explicitly acknowledges this relationship: "Pytest is known for its simplicity, scalability, and powerful features such as fixture support and parameterization"[11](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/pytest/links/pytest-v-unittest/) while noting it's not part of the standard library—presenting a clear trade-off.

This framing transforms your paper from potentially contradictory findings into a valuable contribution that completes the picture of testing framework selection in Python.

# More Questions
Based on the detailed paper by Barbosa and Hora you've shared, I can now provide more targeted advice for moving forward with your research.

## Reconciling Your Findings with Existing Research

Your performance metrics show unittest is significantly faster (0.137s vs 0.338s), while Barbosa and Hora document a strong migration trend toward pytest despite it not being part of the standard library. This creates a perfect research opportunity:

**Your research adds the crucial performance dimension that was missing from the existing literature.**

## Recommended Approach for Your Paper

1. **Frame your research as complementary**: Position your work as adding objective performance metrics to the qualitative migration factors identified by Barbosa and Hora.
    
2. **Develop a cost-benefit framework**: Create a decision matrix showing when each framework might be preferred:
    
    - When is the 2.5x performance difference significant enough to choose unittest?
        
    - When do pytest's developer experience benefits outweigh performance concerns?
        
3. **Connect with key findings from the reference paper**:
    
    - Barbosa and Hora found migrated test code is 34% smaller with pytest
        
    - They identified fixture flexibility/reuse as a major migration motivator
        
    - Their finding that 41% of systems are "still migrating" suggests the migration isn't always straightforward
        
4. **Expand your testing scenarios**:
    
    - Add tests of varying complexity to see if the performance gap changes
        
    - Test with larger test suites to evaluate scaling behavior
        
    - Implement fixtures that can be reused to see if that affects relative performance
        

## Paper Structure for a 15-Page Bachelor's Paper

1. **Introduction** (2 pages): Highlight the tension between developer preferences (moving to pytest) and your performance findings
    
2. **Background and Related Work** (3 pages): Summarize Barbosa and Hora's key findings and other related literature
    
3. **Methodology** (3 pages): Explain your experimental design, metrics collection, and statistical approach
    
4. **Results** (3 pages): Present your performance findings with visualizations
    
5. **Discussion** (3 pages): Analyze the trade-offs between developer experience and performance

This approach respects your academic level as a second-year CS student while creating a paper that makes a genuine contribution to understanding the Python testing ecosystem.


# CPU Usage 
You're right - for your specific use case of comparing Python testing frameworks, CPU delta measurement is significantly less useful than memory usage and execution time metrics for several reasons:

1. **High Variability**: CPU usage fluctuates dramatically even for identical test runs, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions
    
2. **Framework Comparison Focus**: The primary differences between unittest and pytest are in their architecture, memory management, and execution strategy - not CPU utilization
    
3. **Simple Test Cases**: With your calculator example, CPU usage will be minimal and dominated by framework overhead rather than actual computation
    
4. **Measurement Challenges**: A simple before/after CPU delta misses the dynamic CPU usage during test execution, unlike memory which can be meaningfully measured as a delta
    
5. **Research Relevance**: For your paper comparing framework performance, execution time and memory usage are the standard metrics that developers actually consider when choosing a testing framework
    

Memory usage directly reflects each framework's efficiency and overhead, while execution time provides the most practical performance indicator for developers. These two metrics already give you scientifically meaningful data that aligns with the focus of your research paper.

If you want to enhance your measurements, consider instead adding test complexity variations to see how memory and time metrics scale with larger test suites - this would provide more valuable insights than CPU measurements.


# Writing Framework (new?) (Perplexity/Claude)

Looking at your benchmark results comparing unittest and pytest, here's a framework to structure your paper that connects with the Barbosa and Hora research:

## Introduction (2-3 pages)

Frame your research as complementary to Barbosa and Hora's work - while they explored the motivations and patterns of framework migration, your paper examines the objective performance differences between frameworks. This creates a more complete picture for developers making migration decisions.

**Key research questions:**

- How do unittest and pytest compare in terms of execution time and memory usage?
    
- Do these performance metrics align with or challenge the reasons developers migrate?
    

## Literature Review (3-4 pages)

- Summarize Barbosa and Hora's key findings about migration patterns
    
- Note their discovery that migrated pytest code is typically 34% smaller than unittest
    
- Discuss their identified migration motivations (easier syntax, fixture flexibility/reuse)
    
- Highlight their finding that 34% of systems use both frameworks simultaneously
    

## Methodology (2-3 pages)

Detail your experimental approach:

- Testing environment (your performance_metrics.py implementation)
    
- Test suite design (the calculator example)
    
- Statistical rigor (100 iterations, warmup runs, bootstrap sampling)
    
- Subprocess isolation for cleaner measurements
    

## Results (2-3 pages)

Present your findings clearly with visualizations:

- Unittest is significantly faster (mean execution time: ~0.122s vs. ~0.313s for pytest)
    
- Memory usage is comparable (mean usage: ~0.157MB for unittest vs. ~0.154MB for pytest)
    
- Include your statistical analysis to demonstrate the reliability of these findings
    

## Discussion (3-4 pages)

This is where you connect your performance metrics to Barbosa and Hora's findings:

- Despite unittest's better performance, developers still migrate to pytest
    
- Explore the tension between objective performance and subjective developer experience
    
- Analyze how pytest's feature benefits may outweigh its performance costs
    
- Create a decision framework to help developers weigh performance vs. other factors
    

## Conclusion (1-2 pages)

Synthesize your contribution to the understanding of testing framework selection.


# Understanding the Statistical Values in Your Results (Perplexity/Claude)
**Mean vs Median:**

- **Mean** (e.g., 0.122s for unittest): The average execution time across all 100 runs
    
- **Median** (e.g., 0.119s for unittest): The middle value when all times are arranged from fastest to slowest
    
- When mean > median (as in your unittest results), it suggests some slower outlier runs1
    

**Standard Deviation (stdev):**

- Measures variability/consistency of performance
    
- Unittest stdev (0.012s) is lower than pytest (0.022s), indicating more consistent performance15
    

**Confidence Interval:**

- Range where the true average likely falls with 95% certainty
    
- For unittest: approximately 0.120s to 0.125s
    
- Narrower interval for unittest indicates more reliable performance estimation15
    

**Bootstrap Statistics:**

- A resampling technique that creates multiple simulated samples from your data
    
- Provides more robust statistical estimates, especially for comparing frameworks
    
- The bootstrap confidence intervals in your results show the same patterns as the traditional statistics, confirming your findings12
    

**Practical Interpretation:**

- Unittest performs about 2.5x faster than pytest (0.122s vs 0.313s)
    
- Both frameworks use similar memory, with unittest slightly higher (0.157MB vs 0.154MB)
    
- The performance difference is statistically significant based on the non-overlapping confidence intervals15
    

These results create an interesting complement to Barbosa and Hora's findings - developers are migrating to a framework that objectively performs worse in speed tests, suggesting that the qualitative benefits (fixture reuse, simpler syntax, etc.) outweigh the performance costs.


# Why is Pytest slower? (Perplexity/Claude)
Based on your benchmark results showing pytest being significantly slower than unittest (0.313s vs 0.122s mean execution time), I can explain several technical reasons for this performance difference:

## Test Discovery and Collection Overhead

Pytest performs a much more comprehensive test discovery process than unittest[13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16417546/how-to-speed-up-pytest/19675357). While this enables its flexible test discovery capabilities, it comes with significant overhead:

- Pytest imports and analyzes all modules in the testpaths directories to find test functions[13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16417546/how-to-speed-up-pytest/19675357)
    
- The framework scans for test functions that don't need to follow strict class hierarchies, requiring more introspection
    
- This import and analysis process happens even when you specify exact test files to run[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9vdps1/why_is_pytest_so_slow/)
    

## Plugin Architecture and Framework Initialization

Pytest's architecture is inherently more complex:

- It uses a plugin-based system that requires loading and initializing multiple components before tests run[8](https://www.clariontech.com/blog/pytest-vs-unittest-python-frameworks)
    
- Even for simple test cases, pytest sets up its entire infrastructure, including fixture management systems[8](https://www.clariontech.com/blog/pytest-vs-unittest-python-frameworks)
    
- The framework loads all configured plugins on startup, adding overhead even when those plugins aren't used for specific tests[14](https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-advanced/pytest-improve-runtime/)
    

## Advanced Feature Support

The rich feature set of pytest requires additional runtime processing:

- Pytest's powerful fixture system requires dependency resolution and management at runtime[10](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/03/pytest-vs-unittest)
    
- Its detailed introspection for assertion messages means it needs to parse and analyze Python assertions[8](https://www.clariontech.com/blog/pytest-vs-unittest-python-frameworks)
    
- Support for parameterization and sophisticated test selection requires additional processing logic[10](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/03/pytest-vs-unittest)
    

## Import System Complexity

For your simple calculator tests, this difference is particularly noticeable:

- Unittest's class-based approach has less import overhead and follows a simpler execution path
    
- Pytest needs to build a more complex execution graph due to its fixture system
    
- The framework spends time setting up capabilities you aren't using in simple tests
    

This explains why unittest performs about 2.5x faster in your benchmarks, despite pytest offering more features. The performance difference would likely narrow in more complex test suites where pytest's features provide more value than the initialization overhead costs.



# Making Code/Project more universal? (Perplexity/Claude)
To transform your `performance_metrics.py` into a universal testing framework comparison tool that works with all the datasets you've discovered, you'll need to make several enhancements:

## Making Your Code More Universal

### 1. Test Discovery and Adaptation

```python
def discover_tests(self, project_path):
    """Discover unittest and pytest tests in a project directory structure."""
    unittest_tests = []
    pytest_tests = []
    
    for root, _, files in os.walk(project_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.startswith("test_") and file.endswith(".py"):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                
                # Check if file contains unittest or pytest patterns
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                    
                if "unittest" in content or "TestCase" in content:
                    unittest_tests.append(file_path)
                if "pytest" in content or "@pytest" in content or "assert " in content:
                    pytest_tests.append(file_path)
                    
    return unittest_tests, pytest_tests
```

### 2. Batch Test Runner

```python
def batch_test_comparison(self, project_path, iterations=100):
    """Run performance comparison on all tests in a project."""
    unittest_tests, pytest_tests = self.discover_tests(project_path)
    
    results = {
        "project": os.path.basename(project_path),
        "unittest_results": [],
        "pytest_results": []
    }
    
    # Run unittest tests
    for test in unittest_tests:
        unittest_metrics = PerformanceMetrics("unittest", os.path.basename(test))
        unittest_cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "unittest", test]
        unittest_metrics.measure_performance_subprocess(unittest_cmd, iterations)
        results["unittest_results"].append(unittest_metrics.get_summary())
    
    # Run pytest tests
    for test in pytest_tests:
        pytest_metrics = PerformanceMetrics("pytest", os.path.basename(test))
        pytest_cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", test]
        pytest_metrics.measure_performance_subprocess(pytest_cmd, iterations)
        results["pytest_results"].append(pytest_metrics.get_summary())
    
    return results
```

### 3. Command-Line Interface

```python
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Compare unittest and pytest performance')
    parser.add_argument('project_path', help='Path to the project containing tests')
    parser.add_argument('--iterations', type=int, default=100, help='Number of test iterations')
    parser.add_argument('--output', default='results', help='Output directory for results')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    comparator = TestFrameworkComparator(args.output)
    results = comparator.batch_test_comparison(args.project_path, args.iterations)
    comparator.generate_comparison_report(results)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 4. Integrating with Test Migration Datasets

To work with the datasets from the Barbosa and Hora paper, especially the TestMigrationsInPy repository with 923 real-world migrations:

```python
def analyze_migration_test_pair(self, unittest_file, pytest_file, iterations=100):
    """Analyze performance for a migration pair (unittest → pytest)."""
    unittest_metrics = PerformanceMetrics("unittest", os.path.basename(unittest_file))
    unittest_cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "unittest", unittest_file]
    unittest_metrics.measure_performance_subprocess(unittest_cmd, iterations)
    
    pytest_metrics = PerformanceMetrics("pytest", os.path.basename(pytest_file))
    pytest_cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", pytest_file]
    pytest_metrics.measure_performance_subprocess(pytest_cmd, iterations)
    
    return {
        "unittest": unittest_metrics.get_summary(),
        "pytest": pytest_metrics.get_summary(),
        "comparison": self.compare_frameworks(unittest_metrics, pytest_metrics)
    }
```

## Implementing Framework Comparison

Add a method to compare frameworks statistically:

```python
def compare_frameworks(self, unittest_metrics, pytest_metrics):
    """Perform statistical comparison between frameworks."""
    unittest_times = [run["execution_time_seconds"] for run in unittest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    pytest_times = [run["execution_time_seconds"] for run in pytest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    
    # Perform t-test for execution time
    t_stat_time, p_value_time = stats.ttest_ind(unittest_times, pytest_times, equal_var=False)
    
    # Test memory usage
    unittest_mem = [run["memory_delta_mb"] for run in unittest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    pytest_mem = [run["memory_delta_mb"] for run in pytest_metrics.results["runs"]]
    t_stat_mem, p_value_mem = stats.ttest_ind(unittest_mem, pytest_mem, equal_var=False)
    
    return {
        "time_difference_percentage": ((statistics.mean(pytest_times) / statistics.mean(unittest_times)) - 1) * 100,
        "memory_difference_percentage": ((statistics.mean(pytest_mem) / statistics.mean(unittest_mem)) - 1) * 100,
        "time_comparison": {
            "t_statistic": t_stat_time,
            "p_value": p_value_time,
            "significant_difference": p_value_time 
        
            Testing Framework Performance Comparison
            
            
        
        
            
                Testing Framework Performance Comparison
                Project: {results['project']}
                
                
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                
                
                
                    Detailed Results
                    
                
            
            
            
                // Chart.js code to generate charts
            
        
    
    """
    
    with open(os.path.join(self.output_dir, f"{results['project']}_report.html"), "w") as f:
        f.write(report)
```
